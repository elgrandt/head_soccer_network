# HeadSoccer

Welcome, this is my first project in github. In order tu run the source code you will need pygame, pybox2d, and our modified version of podsixnet to support the udp network protocoll. To test the binary releases you can download them from mega, https://mega.co.nz/#!9o42Uaha!YldRWQg9BWOGs7JYvNIZgno0ZFqeOpczLrws_XZH5Fo for windows and https://mega.co.nz/#!Yx5WnbhD!A5un6aOQNHHDCBxXgB4gs8ZnU-xCP25LvbHbQ2Gl_DI for linux. All versions include server and client versions. The client run file is *main.py* while the server one is *server_run.py*. You can update some constants and configuration in data/config.py. The project is not very commented because it is very new but in the future we will add comments to each file
